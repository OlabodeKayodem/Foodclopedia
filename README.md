# Foodclopedia
Foodclopedia is an innovative AI-powered platform developed during a hackathon, leveraging Azure AI and custom GPT technology to provide personalized information about African cuisine. The platform was trained using an extensive collection of PDFs and documents on African food, enabling it to generate detailed and context-rich responses about traditional dishes, cooking methods, and cultural food practices across the continent.

Using the powerful capabilities of Azure AI, Foodclopedia allows users to interact with an AI-driven chatbot that can suggest recipes, explain the history and significance of various African foods, and provide guidance on how to prepare traditional meals. The system offers a unique opportunity to engage with African food culture in an accessible, modern way.

The project aims to preserve and promote African gastronomic heritage while also bridging cultural gaps by making African cuisine more widely accessible. It serves as an educational tool that raises awareness and appreciation for African food traditions, all within an intuitive and easy-to-use platform developed during a collaborative hackathon experience.
